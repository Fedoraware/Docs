# FAQ

## Why does the cheat not work?

If the cheat does not work properly or the menu doesn't appear after injecting, try the following:

- Make sure that your dxlevel isn't too old. Use at least `dxlevel 90`.
- Use Windows 10 with the latest updates.
- Install or update [C++ Redistributable 2019](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe).
- Disable your antivirus or [add an exception](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26) for Fedoraware.
- Try a different injector and make sure that your injector has admin rights.
- Don't dual inject with other cheats.

In case you tried all of the above, you can get further help in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Fedoraware/Fedoraware/issues) or on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/TungCJfDbh).

## How do I open the menu?

Press the **INSERT** key.

## Where are the configs stored?

You can find the configs in the `Team Fortress 2\FedFigs` folder.
This is also the location for custom materials, Lua scripts and the playerlist.
