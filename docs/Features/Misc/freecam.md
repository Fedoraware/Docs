# Freecam

Freecam allows you to move your camera freely (clientside) and look through walls as long as the dedicated freecam key is being held down.

Your in-game character is not able to move while you're using freecam. As soon as you release the freecam key, your camera will go back to your player and you'll be able to move again.

The movement speed of freecam can also be customized.
