# Crithack

The crit hack will attempt to force random critical hits.

## Options

The master switch dictates whether the crit hack is ran or not.

### Indicators

Indicators will show your bucket and if you are holding your crit key. The bucket is inaccurate and does not really mean anything at the moment.

### Avoid random

Avoid random will try to stop you having any critical hits unless you are holding your crit key.

### Always melee

Always melee will force crits on every single melee swing regardless of if your key is held.

### Crit key

The crit key lets you change which key you need to hold in order to use the crit hack.
