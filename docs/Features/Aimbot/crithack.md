# Crithack

The crit hack will attempt to force random critical hits.

---

The master switch dictates whether the crit hack is ran or not.

Indicators will show your bucket and if you are holding your crit key. The bucket is inaccurate and does not really mean anything at the moment.

Avoid random will try to stop you having any critical hits unless you are holding your crit key.

Always melee will force crits on every single melee swing regardless of if your key is held.

The crit key lets you change which key you need to hold in order to use the crit hack.
