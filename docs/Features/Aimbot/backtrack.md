# Backtrack

Backtrack abuses lag exploitation to hit past records of players

## Options

The master switch controls if backtrack is enabled or not.

### Aimbot aims at last tick

Aimbot aims at last tick will make the aimbot aim at the last available record for the target if the main player is not visible. This is currently very BAD and only works on hitscan.

The latency slider will enable fake latency if above 0. This is also currently very BAD and mostly useless.
