# Global

The global settings for aimbot dictate how all 3 types of aimbot work (Hitscan, Projectile, Melee)

---

The master switch toggles on all aimbot functionality.

The aimbot key lets you change which key you need to hold in order to use the aimbot.

The aimbot FOV slider filters which targets to aim at who are within that many degrees of field of vision

Aim targets lets you filter types of targets out (players, buildings, stickies)

Ignored targets filters targets out based on an attribute of sorts (invulnerable, cloaked, friend)
