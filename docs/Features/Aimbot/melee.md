# Melee

The sort method chooses how it prioritizes which player to aim at. FOV means it will choose whoever has the least amount of distance from the center of your crosshair, while distance means it will choose whoever has the least amount of in-game distance from your players position.

There are 3 aim methods for melee aimbot:

- Plain - Plain aimbot will snap your camera to where it aims at instantly.
- Smooth - Smooth aimbot will snap your camera to where it should aim slowly, making it appear more "legit" in some cases.
- Silent - Silent aimbot will aim at the target, but your camera doesn't look at them.

## Smooth factor

Smooth factor affects how long it takes for the aimbot to reach its target. Higher is smoother, lower is snappier.

## Range check

Range check will make the aimbot only target players who are within the bounds of your melee.

## Swing prediction

Swing prediction will take your movement into account, predicting if you're in range to hit the target in the future and take advantage of the 0.2 second delay between click and hit that melee has.

## Whip teammates

Whip teammates will attack teammates with the disciplinary action for soldier, giving a speed boost.
