# Fedoraloader

[Fedoraloader](https://github.com/lnx00/Fedoraloader) allows you to automatically download and inject Fedoraware in one simple click.
It also contains an integrated (optional) VAC bypass that will restart steam with the VAC bypass injected.

[Download](https://github.com/lnx00/Fedoraloader/releases/latest){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

You can download either *Fedoraloader.exe* which contains all required dependencies (such as the .NET 6 runtime).
If you already have the .NET runtime installed, you can download *Fedoraloader_Tiny.exe* which is a minimal build with reduces size.
Use the default file if you're unsure.

## Usage

1. Run **Fedoraloader** as adminisrator.
2. Configure the settings (Enable VAC bypass etc.)
3. Click **Inject** and wait until Fedoraloader closes itself.
